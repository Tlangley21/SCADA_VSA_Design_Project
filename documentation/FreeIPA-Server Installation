This program will set up the IPA Server.
Version 4.11.1

This includes:
  * Configure a stand-alone CA (dogtag) for certificate management
  * Configure the NTP client (chronyd)
  * Create and configure an instance of Directory Server
  * Create and configure a Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC)
  * Configure Apache (httpd)
  * Configure DNS (bind)
  * Configure SID generation
  * Configure the KDC to enable PKINIT

To accept the default shown in brackets, press the Enter key.

Enter the fully qualified domain name of the computer
on which you're setting up server software. Using the form
<hostname>.<domainname>
Example: master.example.com


Server host name [scada.ipa.test]: 

Warning: skipping DNS resolution of host scada.ipa.test
The domain name has been determined based on the host name.

Please confirm the domain name [ipa.test]: 

The kerberos protocol requires a Realm name to be defined.
This is typically the domain name converted to uppercase.

Please provide a realm name [IPA.TEST]: 
Certain directory server operations require an administrative user.
This user is referred to as the Directory Manager and has full access
to the Directory for system management tasks and will be added to the
instance of directory server created for IPA.
The password must be at least 8 characters long.

Directory Manager password: 
Password (confirm): 

The IPA server requires an administrative user, named 'admin'.
This user is a regular system account used for IPA server administration.

IPA admin password: 
Password (confirm):

Do you want to search for missing reverse zones? [yes]: no
Trust is configured but no NetBIOS domain name found, setting it now.
Enter the NetBIOS name for the IPA domain.
Only up to 15 uppercase ASCII letters, digits and dashes are allowed.
Example: EXAMPLE.


NetBIOS domain name [IPA]: IPA01

Do you want to configure chrony with NTP server or pool address? [no]: yes
Enter NTP source server addresses separated by comma, or press Enter to skip: time.google.com

The IPA Master Server will be configured with:
Hostname:       scada.ipa.test
IP address(es): 192.168.8.100
Domain name:    ipa.test
Realm name:     IPA.TEST

The CA will be configured with:
Subject DN:   CN=Certificate Authority,O=IPA.TEST
Subject base: O=IPA.TEST
Chaining:     self-signed

BIND DNS server will be configured to serve IPA domain with:
Forwarders:       8.8.8.8
Forward policy:   only
Reverse zone(s):  No reverse zone

NTP server:	time.google.com
Continue to configure the system with these values? [no]: yes

The following operations may take some minutes to complete.
Please wait until the prompt is returned.

==============================================================================
Setup complete

Next steps:
	1. You must make sure these network ports are open:
		TCP Ports:
		  * 80, 443: HTTP/HTTPS
		  * 389, 636: LDAP/LDAPS
		  * 88, 464: kerberos
		  * 53: bind
		UDP Ports:
		  * 88, 464: kerberos
		  * 53: bind
		  * 123: ntp

	2. You can now obtain a kerberos ticket using the command: 'kinit admin'
	   This ticket will allow you to use the IPA tools (e.g., ipa user-add)
	   and the web user interface.

Be sure to back up the CA certificates stored in /root/cacert.p12
These files are required to create replicas. The password for these
files is the Directory Manager password
The ipa-server-install command was successful
